## About

GarageLog was originally developed as part of a university summer course in
Android application development. The assignment was to design and build a fully
functional Android app of our choice, demonstrating the concepts learned
throughout the course.

A detailed project report (in Swedish) can be found
[here](https://github.com/jonwin1/GarageLog/rapport.pdf). It covers the app‚Äôs
features, architecture, and design decisions in depth.
